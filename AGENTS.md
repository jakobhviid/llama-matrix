# Agent guidelines

Instructions for any AI coding agent (Claude Code, opencode, Cursor, …) working
in this repository.

## Attribution — never attribute AI in the repo

- **Never** add AI/assistant attribution to commits or pull requests: no
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any other assistant) trailer, and no
  "🤖 Generated with …" line. Author every commit solely as the repository owner.
- AI assistance is disclosed **once**, in the README's "AI disclosure" section —
  that is the only place it belongs. Keep it out of the commit history entirely.
- If your tooling adds attribution by default, **turn it off at the source instead of
  fighting it per commit, and help the user do the same.** For Claude Code, set
  `includeCoAuthoredBy` to `false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (it is on by default).
  A one-liner to hand the user (needs `jq`):

  ```sh
  f=~/.claude/settings.json; [ -f "$f" ] || printf '{}' > "$f"; \
    tmp=$(mktemp); jq '.includeCoAuthoredBy = false' "$f" > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" "$f"
  ```

  Once it is off, no attribution is emitted at all and this rule holds effortlessly.

## Releases & versioning — auto-incremented from commit type

CI cuts a release on every push to `main`, and the version is **derived
automatically from the commit history** (Conventional Commits) — nobody bumps a
version by hand, so a forgotten manual release still versions correctly. The
commit **subject prefix** decides the bump:

- `feat: …` — a new feature → **minor** bump (1.2.0 → 1.3.0)
- `fix: …` — a bug fix / hotfix → **patch** bump (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
- `feat!: …` (or any `type!:`, e.g. `fix!:`), or a `BREAKING CHANGE` — a breaking
  change → **major** bump (1.4.2 → 2.0.0)
- anything else (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, …) or an un-prefixed subject →
  **patch** bump

So **pick the right commit-subject prefix for the change** and the release version
follows automatically. Never hand-edit `version` in `Cargo.toml` to release — CI
computes and stamps it.

**Green-gate before you push, or no release is cut.** The release job first runs
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` and the test suite; if
either fails, the push does **not** publish. `cargo build`/`cargo test` alone is
not enough — **clippy is the gate** (warnings are errors), so run
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` locally before every
push.

There is deliberately **no** `cargo fmt` gate. The reason, so it isn't
re-litigated: the tree is already rustfmt-shaped (the clippy gate keeps it tidy),
so a gate would catch drift that isn't happening — while forcing a `rust-toolchain.toml`
pin, since a fmt check against the floating `stable` channel breaks whenever
rustfmt's output shifts. Near-zero benefit for real ongoing cost. If you ever *do*
want it, add the toolchain pin in the same change and run it as a separate lint
workflow (never in `release.yml`, where a whitespace diff would block a release).
